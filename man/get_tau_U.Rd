\usage{
get_tau_U(
  Tau_U,
  omega,
  P_tilde,
  aggregate_population = "Skeena",
  upper_populations = c("Middle Skeena", "Large Lakes", "Upper Skeena"),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{Tau_U}{Numeric, vector of total terminal mortalities in the upper Skeena (upstream of Terrace), by year. Combination of FSC and recreational. Note uppercase Tau denotes total not broken out by population or age.}

\item{omega}{Numeric, array of proportions of each age with three dimensions: population (i), year (y), and age (a).}

\item{P_tilde}{Numeric, array of genetic proportions at Skeena Tyee test fishery with 2 dimensions: i (population) and year (y).}

\item{aggregate_population}{Character, name of aggregate population. Defaults to "Skeena"}

\item{upper_populations}{Character, vector of names of upper populations. Defaults to Middle Skeena, Large Lakes, and Upper Skeena.}

\item{lower_populations}{Character, vector of names of lower populations. Defaults to Lower Skeena, Kitsumkalum, and Zymoetz-Fiddler.}
}
\value{
A list with two objects. First object: numeric, array of total terminal mortalities in the upper Skeena with three dimensions: population (i), year (y), and age (a).
Second object: data frame with same data in long format (columns for population, year, and age) for plotting.
}
\description{
Calculates the total terminal mortalities of Chinook salmon in the upper Skeena River
(upstream of Terrace), by population, year, and age. Includes fishing plus incidental mortality.
Uses genetic data from Skeena Tyee test fishery, not CTC model outputs.
