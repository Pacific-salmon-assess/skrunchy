**Run** Reconstruction for **Sk**eena **Ch**inook

The goal of skrunchy is to recreate and update the run reconstruction
for Skeena River (summer run timing) Chinook upstream of Tyee test
fishery, as documented in \[Winther et
al. 2024\]{<https://publications.gc.ca/site/eng/9.901355/publication.html>}

## Installation

You can install the development version of skrunchy from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("Pacific-salmon-assess/skrunchy")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
#library(skrunchy)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
#summary(cars)
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
