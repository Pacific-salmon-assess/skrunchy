**Sk**eena River **Run** Reconstruction for **Ch**inook

The goal of skrunchy is to recreate and update the run reconstruction
for Skeena River (summer run timing) Chinook upstream of Tyee test
fishery, as documented in [Winther et
al.Â 2024](https://publications.gc.ca/site/eng/9.901355/publication.html "An assessment of Skeena River Chinook salmon using genetic stock identification 1984 to 2020")

## Installation

You can install the development version of skrunchy from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("Pacific-salmon-assess/skrunchy")
```

<!-- ## Example -->
<!-- This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: -->
<!-- ```{r example} -->
<!-- #library(skrunchy) -->
<!-- ## basic example code -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->
<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- #summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. -->
<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->
<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- #plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
